This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other by taking turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O.

The game logic includes:

Turn-based play between Player X and Player O

Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

Draw condition detection

Game reset functionality

The interface is designed to be clean and responsive, providing a smooth user experience across devices. This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation in JavaScript.
